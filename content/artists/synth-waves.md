# About Synth Waves

Synth Waves is Moncton's answer to the global synthwave movement, crafting lush, nostalgic soundscapes that transport listeners back to the golden age of 80s electronic music.

## Musical Background

Inspired by the soundtrack work of John Carpenter, Vangelis, and modern artists like Kavinsky and The Midnight, Synth Waves began producing in 2020 during the pandemic. What started as a bedroom project has grown into a respected name in the Atlantic electronic music scene.

## Sound & Production

Using a combination of vintage synthesizers, modern VSTs, and analog outboard gear, Synth Waves creates warm, analog-sounding tracks that feel both nostalgic and fresh. Heavy use of arpeggios, vintage drum machines, and dreamy pads define the sound.

## Visual Aesthetic

Each release is accompanied by carefully curated retro-futuristic artwork featuring neon grids, sunsets, and sports cars - a visual complement to the sonic experience.

## Live Shows

Synth Waves' live performances feature a hardware-focused setup with multiple synthesizers, creating an immersive audiovisual experience complete with custom visuals and retro lighting.

## Community Involvement

Active in building the Moncton electronic music community, Synth Waves organizes monthly "Retro Electronica" nights featuring local and visiting electronic artists.
